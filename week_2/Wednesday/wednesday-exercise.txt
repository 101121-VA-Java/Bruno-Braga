Go line by line, and explain what's happening in each line.

int score = 80; // A variable of type int and of name score is declared and is assigned a value of 80;

String result; // declare a varivable of type String.

if (score == 80) { // it verify if score vabiable has a value stored into that is equals to 80
	result = "You passed!"; // store the "You passed" string into the result variable if the line above results to true.
} else if (score > 80) { // if line 7 is false the program go to this line and try the it verify if score vabiable has a value stored into that is greater to 80 
	result = "You did great!"; // if th eline 9 results to a boolean true this line will store the "You did great" string into the result variable.
} else { // if the line 7 and 9 are both false the program executes this line and the line bellow. 
	result = "You did not pass. Try again!"; //this line store the string "You did not pass. Try again!" into the result variable.
}

System.out.println(result); // prints the string the is store
